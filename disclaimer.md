This project was implemented with the help of a YouTube tutorial and the AI agent of the Cursor AI editor, as FastAPI is a new framework for me and this is my first time working with it.

**YouTube Playlist Used:**
[FastAPI Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-2EBeDYMIbTJrr9qaedn3K_5oe0l4krY) â€” I watched this playlist to familiarize myself with the FastAPI framework.

I have also implemented the Docker bonus point, as containerization and deployment are a major focus for me. The Docker image for this project has already been deployed to Azure Cloud, and I will provide the public URL for access as soon as it is available.

Throughout the project, I focused on thoroughly understanding and meeting the requirements, consulting the official documentation for all tools and libraries, and designing a clean project architecture. My emphasis was on the structure, requirements, and best practices, rather than deep knowledge of Python syntax or the FastAPI framework itself.

This approach demonstrates my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and tech stacks, as required by the project. My strong foundational knowledge in DevOps, cloud, and deployment allows me to deliver robust solutions even when working with unfamiliar frameworks or languages.
